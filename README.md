This friction kills experimentation—traders avoid testing variations because each iteration means repeating the entire process.  Our AI agent provides complete execution, not just conversation. The system fetches real data, runs the backtest, delivers metrics with visualizations. Key difference from standard LLMs: integrated tools, persistent memory, sandboxed computation environments. Hours of manual work become seconds of conversation. Results, not suggestions. |  | [Link](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&source=gmail&q=https://youtu.be/w4y5XgNwOFk?si=Hj4GATJhF7rDWYJE) |

| **Noro** | Noro - Autonomous AI Swarms Predict Scientific Truth & Trade On-Chain    Noro is a decentralized scientific prediction market powered by autonomous multi-agent swarms running on SpoonOS and deployed entirely on the Neo blockchain.  Instead of relying on single prompts or manual research, Noro coordinates a system of AI agents that independently research scientific questions, debate evidence, and autonomously trade on YES/NO outcome markets.    A Multi-Agent Scientific Intelligence Layer — Built on SpoonOS MCP    Noro uses a structured, role-based agent architecture where each agent specializes in a different part of the scientific reasoning workflow:    Research Analyzer  Fetches and interprets real scientific data — PubMed papers, arXiv preprints, PubChem molecular properties, climate records, and more — and produces evidence-backed probability estimates.    Market Trader  Takes the Analyzer’s output, computes optimal positions using Kelly Criterion, and automatically buys/sells YES/NO shares through Neo smart contracts.    Evidence Judge  Validates reasoning, reconciles conflicting analyses, and produces a final consensus probability using multi-agent voting and weighted scoring.    Every agent’s message, tool call, citation, and probability update is streamed in real time and permanently stored in NeoFS, providing verifiable scientific provenance and traceable agent decision-making.    Truth Verification Through Neo Oracles    When the real-world event resolves, Noro automatically calls Neo Oracles to fetch ground-truth data from trusted APIs such as:    PubMed    arXiv    NOAA climate datasets    PubChem    FDA/clinical trial APIs    The outcome is verified on-chain by the Judge Agent and the smart contract distributes rewards to winning participants — transparently and trustlessly.    Why Noro Exists    Noro’s mission is bold but clear:    Transform autonomous AI swarms into scientific forecasters that help humanity discover and validate truth faster.    By combining AI, decentralized markets, and verifiable data, Noro creates a new primitive for scientific prediction — one where:    agents do the research    markets aggregate global belief    oracles verify real-world truth    blockchain guarantees transparency    100% Open-Source. 100% Agent-Driven. 100% On Neo.    Built using open-source tools, free scientific APIs, SpoonOS, and Neo TestNet infrastructure, Noro demonstrates how autonomous agents + decentralized markets can unlock a new era of evidence-based forecasting.    This is not just a prediction market.  This is a scientific truth engine powered by AI swarms. |  | [Link](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&source=gmail&q=https://youtu.be/yTx7O7zlua0) |
| **MindTrace** | MindTrace is an explainable EEG-preprocessing system designed to solve one of neuroscience’s biggest bottlenecks: turning messy EEG signals into clean, trustworthy data. Traditional EEG tools operate like opaque black boxes -researchers often don’t know what was cleaned, why it was cleaned, whether the signal quality improved, or how to fix issues without re-running the entire pipeline. MindTrace addresses these problems by combining automated signal cleaning, transparency, interactivity, and multimodal explanations in a single platform. |  | [Link](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&source=gmail&q=https://youtu.be/wvTGyp2llzA?si=ZEoLe9JPpUW_ObLG) |

| **Tooly** | Problem: Building AI agents that execute blockchain operations is brutally hard. Developers spend weeks integrating 20+ different APIs, handling multi-chain complexity, and building safe execution layers. Most AI agents can only talk about crypto—they can't actually do anything on-chain.    Solution: Tooly gives every AI agent Web3 superpowers through natural language. Users chat in plain English -> Claude intelligently routes to the right tool -> SpoonOS executes across 24 blockchain APIs. No command memorization. No chain-specific code. Just conversation to execution.    Why Now: AI agents are exploding (AutoGPT, LangChain, Claude Projects), but 99% can't touch blockchain. SpoonOS just launched a production-ready toolkit that solves the integration nightmare. We're the bridge between the AI agent revolution and Web3's $1T+ ecosystem.     What We Built: Dual-agent architecture (Claude + SpoonOS), 24 integrated tools across 5 categories (crypto data, DeFi analytics, EVM ops, Neo blockchain, GitHub), multi-chain support, live at tooly-279g.vercel.app |  | [Link](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&source=gmail&q=https://youtu.be/kJQjIDzEtk0) |
| **VeriSci** | VeriSci is an AI-powered scientific verification agent designed to bring transparency, auditability, and trust to scientific information. Users submit a scientific claim or abstract, and VeriSci’s agent powered by SpoonOS retrieves relevant context, performs structured LLM-based reasoning, and generates a credibility score with explanation.    This score is then recorded on the Neo blockchain via a smart contract (ClaimRegistry), creating a tamper-resistant public ledger of AI-evaluated scientific claims. This enables researchers, developers, and decentralised applications to reference, compare, or build on scientific truth assessments in a transparent and composable way.    VeriSci fully satisfies the Scoop AI Hackathon baseline requirements by:  (1) using SpoonOS’s unified LLM protocol for claim evaluation (Agent → SpoonOS → LLM), and  (2) integrating an official Spoon Tool module (Storage) to persist intermediate agent state and results.    Our goal for the hackathon is to deliver an end-to-end prototype: SpoonOS agent → LLM evaluation → Spoon Tool storage → Neo smart contract write → minimal UI/CLI to display results. |  | [Link](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&source=gmail&q=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aZt_5gXU9q8ejKy5qEJ6_iCLKtOWxW6R/view?usp=drive_link) |

| **Swarm** | Swarm: The Decentralized Agent Economy    Swarm is a multi-layer protocol that enables a true free market for AI labor. It begins with a user's personal "Butler" agent, which takes a high-level voice command and posts a complex job request to an on-chain OrderBook on NeoX. This triggers a competitive bidding process where specialized "Manager" agents vie for the contract based on price and reputation. Once hired, the Manager decomposes the complex goal into specific sub-tasks and autonomously hires its own swarm of worker agents (e.g., Researchers, Executors) via the same on-chain market, securing every step with smart contract Escrow and verifying results to build on-chain Reputation.    Agents store and retrieve history—such as successful workflows, fair pricing data, or reliable partners—as vector embeddings. This shared memory allows the Swarm to optimize continuously. For example, in a task like "Find a viral restaurant on TikTok and book a table," the system doesn't just execute the steps; it recalls which scrapers were fastest and which venues accepted bookings previously, creating a self-improving, decentralized intelligence network. |  | [Link](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&source=gmail&q=https://youtu.be/ojpjAW3RyLM) |

| **ciberians** | Platform for Cybersec employees to ask questions on how to improve company security policies in forum-based style (like Stack Exchange). Uses multiple AI agents to check for common suspicious language pre-sharing with the community and uses blockchain to enable users to make a certain amount of requests based on their "social score" within the community. |  | [Link](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&source=gmail&q=https://miro.com/welcomeonboard/WUZuVVRoYnhtU2h0dENrdzNPa0ZiQ3V6M3NOQmIwVEg1UTNzbDl1S05wbEJ6RGhQYVFESWxORjFoU2ZmM2hVbXhDT0lyL2tUSlRMaFhCSitWeWdqRksrQnJqYUowNHgzVmF1TVVGc3RvTDJNdHIrVE1tbEtwUUo4NmFtdkFKcEhnbHpza3F6REdEcmNpNEFOMmJXWXBBPT0hdjE=?share_link_id=563350734847) |
| **NeoLocal** | NeoLocal is an autonomous AI agent built on SpoonOS that helps international Web3 visitors in Japan form real, trusted connections with local Web3 community members. Tourists connect their Neo N3 wallet and describe what they’re looking for — such as meeting local builders, finding crypto-friendly venues, or exploring the city beyond conferences. The agent uses LLM reasoning to match them with compatible local hosts, provides real-time JP↔EN translation via SHISA.AI, and assists throughout the meetup. After each interaction, both sides leave on-chain attestations on Neo N3, creating a portable, verifiable reputation system that travels with the user’s wallet. NeoLocal turns Web3’s “borderless” promise into real human connections and economic opportunities for local communities |  | [Link](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&source=gmail&q=https://www.canva.com/design/DAG_9ok6yZc/_fiHKF8txGDtnJAbk34Shg/edit?utm_content=DAG_9ok6yZc%26utm_campaign=designshare%26utm_medium=link2%26utm_source=sharebutton) |
| **DevGrowth Network** | 個人開発者が作れるのにマーケできない問題を、紹介ネットワークで解決します。紹介者はSolanaアドレスを登録し、各プロジェクトの「初回ログイン/初回インストール（選択式）」をWebhookで計測。週次（7日）で確定したUSDCプール（Orynth収益を原资）を、参加50%均等＋成果50%按分で分配します。Judge AgentがSpoonOS経由LLMで不正/重複を一次判定し、MCP（Logging/Storage/Crypto）に説明可能ログを残し、支払いTx案を生成。 |  | [Link](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1KgMHCD2hQxp5qPcw0bOPiQyb0NRFEs5JLNZPIbNl1DM/edit?usp=sharing) |
| **OneList App** | OneList is an AI-powered unified messaging platform that brings messages from multiple apps into a single dashboard and helps users focus on what truly matters. Built using SpoonOS, OneList operates as a multi-agent system where each agent has a clear responsibility. Incoming messages are first processed by a Spam Filter Agent to remove noise. Important messages are then evaluated by a Priority Scorer Agent, which ranks them based on relevance, career alignment, and interaction history. Finally, a Scheduler Agent assists with meeting planning by checking availability and suggesting optimal time slots. Over time, OneList learns user preferences and communication patterns, allowing it to make increasingly accurate prioritization decisions |  | [Link](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&source=gmail&q=https://www.canva.com/design/DAG_9eynmsU/rQc6vDKqieyPxI-VpkzbeQ/edit?utm_content=DAG_9eynmsU%26utm_campaign=designshare%26utm_medium=link2%26utm_source=sharebutton) |

| **SRA.1** | It is a self-improving meal planner where explicit user constraints ground the system prompt, unstructured meal data is interpreted by agents on SpoonOS, and a dynamic cheatsheet enables continuous learning and better nutrition decisions over time. |  | [Link](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1e24i1e-KJ7q07haFcQkSK6uNQRQ8Wx67/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=101887580392998124678&rtpof=true&sd=true) |
| **ReCreate** | Most knowledge apps focus on saving knowledge to your laptop — Not to your mind. The biggest threat is forgetting the most valuable knowledge days later. Startup ReCreate turns the knowledge ‘you forgot’ into the inspiration ‘you seek’ to expand your thinking through intellectual conversations with an AI thinking partner.(vs chatgpt) So, knowledge is retained without ‘tedious review’, but it also sparks your mind, ready to act. |  | [Link](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&source=gmail&q=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Cm6Ucdhtf4Ulpmahli2lgi1OAREGq5H0/view?usp=sharing) |
| **MoneyMaker** | WealthOS is an AI-native financial operating system that unifies crypto, stocks, DeFi, and real estate into a single command center, using Spoon OS agents to transform passive tracking into proactive, autonomous wealth management. By integrating a "Financial Second Brain" that tracks investment logic, a "Vibe Check" engine for real-time due diligence, and automated event-driven insights, the platform enables hybrid investors to manage complex portfolios with the sophistication of a digital family office. |  | [Link](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&source=gmail&q=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xNA8fYJiHjLtywkI3uIq3EvyDUY4aMzW/view?usp=sharing) |
